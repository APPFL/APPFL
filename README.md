# APPFL: Argonne Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/appfl/badge/?version=latest)](https://appfl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

APPFL is an open-source software framework that allows research communities to implement, test, and validate various ideas for privacy-preserving federated learning (PPFL).
With this framework, developers and/or users can
- train a user-defined neural network model on **decentralized data with differential privacy**,
- **simulate** various PPFL algorithms on high-performance computing (HPC) architecture with MPI,
- implement **user-defined PPFL algorithms** in a plug-and-play manner.

Such algorithmic components include federated learning (FL) algorithm, privacy technique, communication protocol, FL model to train, and data.
