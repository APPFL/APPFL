## Running Federated Learning on MNIST dataset at NERSC

This tutorial demonstrates how to run a federated learning experiment on the MNIST dataset using APPFL at NERSC. The tutorial consists of three Jupyter notebooks: one for the server and two for the clients. Each client notebook simulates a separate client in the federated learning setup.
