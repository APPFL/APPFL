# ðŸ“€ Datasets

This directory is mainly used for storing user datasets. 
For example, one can make a ``RawData`` subdirectory to store a raw dataset and a ``PreprocessedData`` subdirectory to store a preprocessed dataset, if needed. Please check this [instruction](RawData/README.md) about how to download certain raw datasets.
