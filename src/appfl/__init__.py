APPFL is a privacy-preserving federated learning framework that allows users to implement a federated learning environment with 

* user-defined neural network models (based on ``torch.nn.Module``) and loss function
* customized algorithms
* privacy techniques
* custom decentralized data

The framework is designed to run on a single machine (a laptop or a cluster) as well as multiple heterogeneous machines.
