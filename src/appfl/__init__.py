"""
APPFL is a privacy-preserving federated learning framework that allows users to implement a federated learning environment with 

* user-defined neural network (based on ``torch.nn.Module``) and loss function
* various federated learning algorithms
* privacy-preserving techniques
* custom decentralized data

The framework is designed to run on a single machine (laptop or cluster) for simulation as well as multiple heterogeneous machines for real deployment.
