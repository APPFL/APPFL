# 🗜 Model Parameter Compressor

The `appfl.compressor` module can be used for compressing the model parameters or gradients in a lossy manner before the client sends them back to the server for more efficient communication. The server then will decompress the compressed model before the global aggregation. 

The `appfl.compressor` currently supports the following lossy compressors. Please refer to their official project/GitHub pages if you want more detailed information of them. Here, we only provide the installation instructions. **Note: SZx need particular permission to access because of the collaboration with a third-party, so we omit its installation here.**

3. [ZFP: Compressed Floating-Point and Integer Arrays](https://pypi.org/project/zfpy/)
4. [SZX: An Ultra-fast Error-bounded Lossy Compressor for Scientific Datasets](https://github.com/szcompressor/SZx)

## Installation
Users can easily install all the above compressors by running the following command.
```bash
appfl-install-compressor
```
