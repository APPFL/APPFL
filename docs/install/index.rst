Installation
============

This page describes how to install APPFL on a machine independent of operating systems.

Conda environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We highly recommend to create new conda environment and install the required packages for APPFL.

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n APPFL python=3.10
    conda activate APPFL

User installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For most users, including data scientists, this simple installation is sufficient for running the package.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pip --upgrade
    pip install "appfl[mpi,examples]"

.. note::

    If you do not need to use MPI for simulations, then you can install the package without the ``mpi`` option: ``pip install "appfl[examples]""``.

If you want to even minimize the installation of package dependencies, you can use:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install appfl

.. note::

    ``torch`` may need to be updated manually to support CUDA. Please check GPU support in `PyTorch <pytorch.org>`_.

Developer installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Code developers and contributors may want to work on the local repository.
To set up the development environment,

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone --single-branch --branch main https://github.com/APPFL/APPFL.git
    cd APPFL
    pip install -e ".[dev,mpi,examples]"

.. note::

    If you do not need to use MPI for simulations, then you can install the package without the ``mpi`` option: ``pip install -e ".[dev,examples]"``.

Verify installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To verify the installation, you can run the following command to check the version of APPFL, which should print the installed version without error.

.. code-block:: bash

    python -c "import appfl; print(appfl.__version__)"
