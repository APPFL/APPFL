Quickstart
==========

In this page, we present how to run an example federated learning script on the MNIST dataset using the APPFL package. 

Installation
------------

First, we need to make sure that the APPFL package and its dependencies are installed.Then, change to ``examples`` directory.

.. code-block:: console

    git clone --single-branch --branch main https://github.com/APPFL/APPFL.git
    cd APPFL
    pip install -e ".[examples]"
    cd examples


Serial simulation
-----------------

The first example can be simply run using the following command, which launchs a federated learning experiment with five clients. The federated learning server and five federated learning clients run serially on one machine for simulation.

.. code-block:: console

    python ./serial/run_serial.py --num_clients 5 \
        --server_config ./resources/configs/mnist/server_fedavg.yaml \
        --client_config ./resources/configs/mnist/client_1.yaml 

.. note::

    1. ``--server_config`` specifies the path to the configuration file for the FL server. In this example, we use the FedAvg algorithm as the server algorithm. It should be noted that we can only use synchronous FL algorithms for serial experiments, as it does not make sense to run asynchronous algorithms serially.
    2. ``--client_config`` specifies the path to the base configuration file for all FL clients.
    3. ``--num_clients`` specifies the number of federated learning clients.

MPI simulation
--------------

If we want to run FL experiment in parallel using MPI, we can run the example using the following command, which runs the `FedCompass <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.14675.pdf>`_ algorithm with five clients.

.. code-block:: console

    mpiexec -n 6 python ./mpi/run_mpi.py --server_config ./resources/configs/mnist/server_fedcompass.yaml \
        --client_config ./resources/configs/mnist/client_1.yaml

.. note::

    1. ``-np 6`` in the above command means that we are launching 6 MPI processes. As a result, the number of clients is equal to the number of processes minus one (one MPI process is used as an FL server), which is 5 in this case.
    2. You can easily run different FL algorithms (synchronous and asynchronous) simply by changing the server configuration file accordingly. For example, you can run the `FedAsync <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.03934.pdf>`_ algorithm by changing the server configuration file to `./resources/configs/mnist/server_fedasync.yaml`.

MPI simulation with privacy
---------------------------

As the package name suggests, in addition to general differential privacy techniques, APPFL also provides two special synchronous privacy-preserving algorithms, `IIADMM <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.03672.pdf>`_ and `ICEADMM <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.15318.pdf>`_. We can run the privacy-preserving federated learning (PPFL) algorithms by running the following command.

.. code-block:: console

    mpiexec -n 6 python ./mpi/run_mpi_admm.py --server_config ./resources/configs/mnist/server_iiadmm.yaml
    # OR
    mpiexec -n 6 python ./mpi/run_mpi_admm.py --server_config ./resources/configs/mnist/server_iceadmm.yaml

.. note::

    Compared with ``mpi/run_mpi.py``, ``mpi/run_mpi_admm.py`` has the following additional lines for the client to know its relative sample size and provide to the client agent, which is needed in local training.

    .. code-block:: python

        # (Specific to ICEADMM and IIADMM) Send the sample size to the server and set the client weight
        sample_size = client_agent.get_sample_size()
        client_weight = client_communicator.invoke_custom_action(action='set_sample_size', sample_size=sample_size, sync=True)
        client_agent.trainer.set_weight(client_weight["client_weight"])


gRPC deployment
---------------

To show how to deploy the APPFL package on a real distributed system, we provide an example of running the federated learning experiment on the MNIST dataset using gRPC as the communication protocol. 

First, we need to run the following command to start a federated learning server using ``FedCompass`` algorithm.

.. code-block:: console

    python ./grpc/run_server.py --config ./resources/configs/mnist/server_fedcompass.yaml

Open a second terminal to start a client using the following command to talk to the server.

.. code-block:: console

    python ./grpc/run_client.py --config ./resources/configs/mnist/client_1.yaml

Open a third terminal to start another client using the following command to talk to the server.
    
.. code-block:: console
    
    python ./grpc/run_client.py --config ./resources/configs/mnist/client_2.yaml
