- **[PIN]** This project is part of the `PALISADE-X project <https://www.palisadex.net>`_ funded by DOE ASCR.

- **[PIN]** We preprinted a `paper <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08786v1.pdf>`_ describing the design of APPFLx on arXiv.

- We have integrated **HuggingFace** with APPFLx! You can now employ pretrained model on HuggingFace for federated learning experiments on APPFLx.

- We added a resource monitor in the **Federation Information** page for checking the resource utilizations of the client computing endpoints.

- We supported `Federated Asynchronous <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.03934.pdf>`_ algorithm in APPFLx for asynchronous federated learning experiments!

Roadmap
-------

- Client data distribution visualization: We will soon add the capability for users to check the distribution of data accross different federated learning sites.

- FedBuffer asynchronous algorithm: Integrate `FedBuffer <https://proceedings.mlr.press/v151/nguyen22b/nguyen22b.pdf>`_ into APPFLx.

- LoRA fine-tuning: Integrate `LoRA <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685.pdf>`_ fine-tuning methods to APPFLx to support fine-tuning LLM in a federated manner.
