How to contribute
=================

This is an open-source software project. Code/idea contributions from communities are welcome!

.. note::

    Make sure that any contribution is extensively tested and documented.


Core contributors
-----------------

Core contributors are our project team members and those who are closely collaborating with our team.
These contributors must have direct access to the Github repository and be able to create new branches.

We recommend to create new branches (e.g., ``myid/newalgo``, ``myid/issue99``) for any development and bugfixing activities. Once the activities are completed, please create ``pull request`` ideally with the identification of reviewer(s).


External contributors
---------------------

External contributors are recommended to create a ``folk`` of the repository and make ``pull request`` once the contributions are ready for merge.
